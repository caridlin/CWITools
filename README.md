# CWI Tools (Under development)

'CWI Tools' is a set of python scripts I have developed over three years of working with PCWI (and now KCWI) data. I have tidied them up and am sharing them here as a general tool for PCWI/KCWI users. These tools work on the output cubes from the main PCWI/KCWI pipeline (e.g. icuber, icubed )

The tools are split into three categories:

1. Single-cube: quick stand-alone scripts for manipulating individual cubes
2. Multi-cube:  coadding, continuum + psf subtraction of multiple cubes for a single target
3. Multi-targ:  bash scripts to automatically run coadds/subtraction for multiple targets

See the README in each folder for more information on how to execute the scripts.
