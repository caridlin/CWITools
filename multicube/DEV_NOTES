# Development Notes

Tried using CubEx for PCWI data analysis, but PCWI data has the slices at 90deg to KCWI data, so a lot of the slice-by-slice processing would need to be updated to allow a different orientation. Also, there is a bit of a learning curve to using CubEx and Visit (may still end up using Visit) - and I have developed enough of this code that I may as well finish.

Current issue is continuum (non-PSF) and background subtraction. Ideally this can be done at the cube level (even though the 2D detector plane might be more optimal) for ease-of-use from the end-user perspective. Less convenient to have to switch to a python script and then re-run stages 4-7 of the pipeline.

Steps in continuum cube subtraction (Before PSF sub)

    1. Make WL image - done
    2. Fit X and Y 1D moffats to each source & expand masks - done
    3. Median filter sources in each slice - done
    4. Run polyfit on data to generate continuum cube - done
